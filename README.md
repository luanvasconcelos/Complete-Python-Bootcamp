# Complete-Python-Bootcamp
#### This is a repo of the Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3 course by Udemy and its assessments in order of taken in the description.

NOTE: There are more 'homework' from the course than what's displayed in here in the form of quizzes and coding exercises to be done at the course page itself, which doesn't allow for a file. The most important (and bigger) ones are presented here.

1. The __Objects and Data Structures__ Assessment Test asked to fill answers to questions about basic Python objects and data structures;
2. The __Statements Assessment Test__ requested to fill a series of tasks using control flow structures like 'for' and 'if' and build-in functions such as 'range' and 'split';
