# Complete-Python-Bootcamp
#### This is a repo of the Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3 course by Udemy and its assessments in order of taken in the description.

NOTE: There are more 'homework' from the course than what's displayed in here in the form of quizzes and coding exercises to be done at the course page itself, which doesn't allow for a file. Nevertheless, all the important homeworks, challenges and projects are presented in here.

1. The __Objects and Data Structures__ Assessment Test asked to fill answers to questions about basic Python objects and data structures;
2. The __Statements Assessment Test__ requested to fill a series of tasks using control flow structures like 'for' and 'if' and build-in functions such as 'range' and 'split';
3. The __Guessing Game Challenge__ ordered the creation of a little guess game with the user by using conflow flow architectures and printing statements so one could guess a random number from 1 to 100 with hints like warmer or colder;
4. The __Function Practice Exercises__ demanded solving little problems involving the creation of functions to solve them;
5. The __Functions and Methods Homework__ needed to complete a series of problems encompassing functions and methods to solve them;
6. The __Milestone Project 1__ asked to create a Tic Tac Toe game with the end user and display the 'board' along the players answers;
7. The __Object Oriented Programming Homework__ required the completion of classes attributes and methods to calculate tasks for objects responses;
8. The __OOP Challenge__ asked to create a bank related class and fill methods and attributes to compute a client's name and balance account as it makes deposits and withdraws; 
9. The __Errors and Exceptions Homework__ demanded the use of 'try', 'except' and 'else' statements to to handle errors and exceptions;
10. The __Milestone Project 2__ asked for the creation of a simplified version of Blackjack card game by using OOP to work around objects, attributes, classes and a few functions to make the game with the end user. This assessment was much bigger than the other ones as it involved much more complex actions than the Milestone Project 1;
11. __The Built-in Functions Assessment Test__ nedded the use of python build-in fuctions such as map, reduce, filter, zip and enumerate to complete tasks;
